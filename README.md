Preprocessed edge profile dataset.

Provides:
  - Coating edge profile data.
  - Process variables corresponding to each edge profile.

## Usage

This repository provides scripts to preprocess each version of raw dataset and notebooks to visualize the preprocessed data.

### Cloning the repository

You need:

- `git`
- Python runtime with `pip`

Run the following commands to clone the repository and install the necessary requirements.

```sh
git clone git@github.com:heavyedge/profile-dataset.git
cd profile-dataset
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Downloading the raw dataset (Optional)

Run the following commands to download the raw dataset in the `_data` directory.

```sh
export PROFILES_V1_GDRIVE="..."
export CA_V1_GDRIVE="..."
./setup.sh
```

### Acquiring the preprocessed data

The preprocessed data built by this project can be acquired by directly downloading from the [dataset repository](https://huggingface.co/datasets/jeesoo9595/heavyedge-profiles).
Alternatively, you can perform the preprocessing by yourself if you have downloaded the raw dataset.

Either approach creates the preprocessed data in the `datasets` directory.

#### Direct download

You need:

- [Hugging Face CLI](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/installation)

Run the following command:

```sh
hf download jeesoo9595/heavyedge-profiles --repo-type dataset --local-dir datasets
```

#### Building the dataset

You need:

- `make`

Run the following command:

```sh
make datasets
```

Each `datasets/v*` directory stores preprocessed profiles from the corresponding major version of raw profile dataset.

### Acquiring the visualization result

Preprocessed data are visualized as notebooks in the `examples` directory.

You can either download the notebooks from the [GitHub release](https://github.com/heavyedge/profile-dataset/releases) artifacts, or build the notebook by yourself if you have acquired the preprocessed data.

#### Building the notebooks

You need:

- `make`

```sh
pip install -r examples/requirements.txt
make examples
```

## Contributing

### Configuring git

Configure the local git filter (run once after cloning):

```sh
nbstripout --install --attributes .gitattributes
git config filter.nbstripout.clean "nbstripout"
git config filter.nbstripout.smudge cat
git config filter.nbstripout.required true
```

### Testing

Setting the `HEAVYEDGE_TEST_MODE` environment variable to `1` builds only a small subset of data for testing purpose.

```sh
HEAVYEDGE_TEST_MODE=1 make
```

### Building the container image

`Dockerfile` is provided to facilitate data distribution without sharing secrets.

After downloading the raw dataset and building the preprocessed data and examples, build the image with one of the following target:

- `dev`
  - Includes the raw dataset (`_data`).
  - Includes the preprocessed dataset (`datasets`).
  - Includes the built examples (`examples`).
  - Includes all source files.

### Versioning policy

This repository follows semantic versioning with [Python version specifiers](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/specifications/version-specifiers/):

```
N.N.N[{a|b|rc}N][.postN][.devN]
```

- Final release and pre-release (`N.N.N[{a|b|rc}N]`):
  - Dataset is re-built and deployed to HuggingFace.
  - Examples are re-built using the new dataset and uploaded as release artifacts.
- Post-release (`*.postN`):
  - Dataset is deployed to HuggingFace without re-building.
    This means that only the metadata will change.
  - Examples are re-built using the previous dataset and uploaded as release artifacts.
- Developmental release (`*.devN`):
  - Dataset is not built and not deployed to HuggingFace.
  - Examples are not built and not uploaded as release artifacts.

> **NOTE** : Major version is raised only when the dataset is changed in backwards incompatible way.
> When new data is added, minor version is raised with new `datasets/v*` directory.
